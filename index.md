Hi there, I'm Drew. I like to work with my hands and play with computers. I hold a BS in Mathematics, though wood is my preferred medium.

My hobbies include hi-fidelity audio, playing/maintaining guitars and their peripherals, and - at a dangerous age - I'm teaching myself to skateboard again, a relic activity of my youth in Half Moon Bay.

I am the lead cook of the household and spend a lot of time kneading dough and lighting charcoal.

Thanks for reading!
