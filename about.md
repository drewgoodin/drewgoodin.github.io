I'm a native Californian, having grown up in beautiful Half Moon Bay, now settled in Hayward with my wife, daughter, and Shih Tzu. I like to work with my hands and play with computers. I hold a BS in Mathematics and am pursuing graduate study.

Growing up near a golf course, such became my biggest extracurricular passion in life. In addition to working in the industry throughout school, I have played most of the great iconic courses in Northern California, and some elsewhere. I carry an index of 7, where I seem to have plateaued. 

I also enjoy hi-fidelity audio, playing/maintaining guitars and their peripherals, and - at a dangerous age - am teaching myself to skateboard again, a relic activity of my youth on the coast.

I am the lead cook of the household and spend a lot of time kneading dough and lighting charcoal.

Thanks for reading!
