I'm a native Californian, having grown up in beautiful Half Moon Bay, now settled in Hayward with my wife and Shih Tzu.

After receiving a BS in Mathematics from Purdue University and working as a healthcare systems analyst, I spent time as a carpenter's apprentice in Dallas before returning to the Bay Area in 2017. Since then I have built and sold my own line of guitar speaker enclosures, worked on the engineering team of an interesting company in the AI / building automation field, and now run a small business selling and installing window fashions. Quite a mix, right? Sitting still has never been my forte.

Growing up near a golf course, such became my biggest extracurricular passion in life. In addition to working in the industry throughout school, I have played most of the great iconic courses in Northern California, and some elsewhere. I carry an index of 7, where I seem to have plateaued. 

I also enjoy hi-fidelity audio, tinkering with and occasionally playing guitar, and at the age of [redacted], am teaching myself to skateboard again, a relic activity of my youth on the coast.

I am the lead cook of the household and spend a lot of time kneading dough and lighting charcoal.

Thanks for reading!
