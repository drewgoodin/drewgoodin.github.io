<h3>Hi, I'm Drew.</h3>

<p>I build guitar <a href='https://speakercabs.com'>speaker cabinets</a> and also do light freelance <a href='https://nicedrawers.com'>carpentry</a>.</p>

<p>Despite keeping busy with the above I am always interested in part time work in any cool engaging field, from interesting production work to custom projects where you need a hand, or even sever ops or web development.</p>

<p>On the tech side, I enjoy Perl and web tools developed with it, and have written a few useful ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/quickroute">Quickroute</a> - A mini PSGI framework / router with Mason for templating</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/antilles">Antilles</a> - Static site generator, again with Mason templates (great for building your GitHub pages site, like this one!)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/shim">Shim</a> - Browser-based PSGI blog application</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
