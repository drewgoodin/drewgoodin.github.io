<h3>Hi, I'm Drew.</h3>

<p>I'm the sole owner/builder of <a href="https://dgcab.net">Drew Goodin Guitar Cabinetry</a>.</p>

<p>However, I'm winding that business down to a free-time endeavor in favor of full-time work in tech. </p>

<p>Educated in mathematics, I decided to learn to be a carpenter/woodworker in 2015, and have earned a living into my early 30s doing so. Nevertheless, I have developed and practiced my computing skills during my free time in anticipation of the invetibable day I would decide to move to a full-time career in a less dusty realm.</p>

<p>Here's  my <a href="/resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

<p>I would be well suited in a technical support role where I would be expected to master a product or technology, and then serve as an interface between customers and development/operations. I would like to use such a role to get exposure to a complex, distibuted infrastructure, and someday move into network engineering or SRE.</p>

<p>As a side project, I do everything web/infrastructure related for a cool <a href="https://con-verterz.com">wearable startup</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoy Perl and web tools developed with it, and have written a few useful ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/quickroute">Quickroute</a> - A mini PSGI framework / router with Mason for templating</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/antilles">Antilles</a> - Static site generator, again with Mason templates (great for building your GitHub pages site, like this one!)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/shim">Shim</a> - Browser-based PSGI blog application</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
