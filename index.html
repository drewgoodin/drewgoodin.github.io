<h3>Hi, I'm Drew.</h3>

<p>I'm a tech/math person at heart, but have spent the last few years exploring life in the trades. I enjoy web devlopment and programming, but will soon move on to teaching high school math! I also run a small side business building guitar speaker enclosures:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://speakercabs.com'>https://speakercabs.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Despite keeping busy with the above I am always interested in interesting work when I've available to take it on.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href="/resume-goodin.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

<p>On the tech side, I enjoy Perl and web tools developed with it, and have written a few useful ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/quickroute">Quickroute</a> - A mini PSGI framework / router with Mason for templating</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/antilles">Antilles</a> - Static site generator, again with Mason templates (great for building your GitHub pages site, like this one!)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/shim">Shim</a> - Browser-based PSGI blog application</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
