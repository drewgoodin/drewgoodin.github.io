<h2>Hi, I'm Drew</h2>

<p>I do everything web/infrastructure related for a cool <a href="https://con-verterz.com">wearable startup</a>.</p>

<p>I am also the sole owner/builder of <a href="https://dgcab.net">Drew Goodin Guitar Cabinetry</a>, and handle everything on the technical side for that as well.</p>

<p>Occasionally, I write small tech blurbs, mainly so I can reference them later when I break something: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/blog.html">Blog</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I enjoy Perl and web tools written in it, and have developed a few small-but-useful ones myself:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/slurm">Slurm</a> - Glue module for building a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/HTML::Mason">Mason</a>-based web application in a PSGI environment</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/shim">Shim</a> - Simple browser-based PSGI blog application</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/antilles">Antilles</a> - Static site generator with Mason templating (great for building your GitHub pages site, like this one!)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm always looking for interesting remote work.
