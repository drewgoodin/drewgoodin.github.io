<h3>Hi, I'm Drew.</h3>

<p>I'm a grad student in computational mathematics, and also do some handiwork. I used to use this site as a sort of resume, but don't need to do that anymore. Maybe I'll blog here.</p>

<p>I enjoy Perl and web tools developed with it, and have written a few useful ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/quickroute">Quickroute</a> - A mini PSGI framework / router with Mason for templating</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/antilles">Antilles</a> - Static site generator, again with Mason templates (great for building your GitHub pages site, like this one!)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goodind1/shim">Shim</a> - Browser-based PSGI blog application</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
