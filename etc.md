## Some tools, technical notes, and miscellany. With lots of links.

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby gem. I prefer to set up a local Ruby environment and leave the system installation alone. To do this, try the [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io).

[vim](https://www.vim.org) is my editor of choice. Here is my very simple [.vimrc](/assets/files/vimrc.txt) which I have been using for almost 10 years.

I am an [openSUSE](https://opensuse.org) user and currently run the Leap distribution with the Xfce desktop environment.

I like the [Z-shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), especially with the [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) configuration tool.

Any programming tasks I prefer to tackle in Perl, when possible (when isn't it?). Similar to RVM above, [Perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/) is a great way to use whichever version of Perl you want and install modules independent of your system Perl.
